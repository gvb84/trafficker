Just type 'make' to build the software.

Then run ./gmaps-profile with the appropriate arguments (see -h for help). 
It will build up a profile based on the GMapCatcher directory.

Then run ./gmaps-trafficker with the appropriate arguments (see -h for help).
That should be it.

No guarantees. It's a shoddy proof of concept and it might or might not work at
all depending on your setup, network connection, browser being used or tons
of other different factors.

More information is in the whitepaper in the doc/ directory.
Have fun!
